## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Build Issues
- Check Node.js version (should be 18+)
- Verify all dependencies are installed
- Run `npm run type-check` for TypeScript errors

### Routing Issues
- Ensure `_redirects` file is in `public/` folder
- Check `netlify.toml` redirect rules
- Test SPA routing locally with `npm run preview`

### Environment Variables
- Prefix client variables with `VITE_`
- Set in Netlify dashboard, not in code
- Check variable names for typos
